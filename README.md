 <font color='green'>This application helps researchers to download time series data for any location when user draws region of interest by using the polygon/circle/rectangle features of the map. Currently this application supports four algorithms : NDVI, 2 BDA, 3 BDA, Turbidity Index based on 3 satellite imagery (Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel). A quick video demonstrating the method to use this application has been uploaded. Please watch the video before using the application. You may also contact  the developer of this application at ritikaprasai3@gmail.com should you have any questions or recommendations/suggestion. If you are using the application for your research please cite the application using the given information</font>
